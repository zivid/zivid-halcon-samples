## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and
**Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on
how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use
the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D
image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data
from the camera can be used.

  - **Camera**
      - **Basic**
          - [Capture](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/Capture.hdev) - Capture a 3D color point cloud from the camera and use it
            to generate a HALCON ObjectModel3D which is then visualized.
          - [CaptureHDR](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/CaptureHDR.hdev) - Capture an HDR image from the camera and use it to
            generate a HALCON ObjectModel3D which is then visualized.
          - [CaptureHDRCompleteSettings](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/CaptureHDRCompleteSettings.hdev) - Capture an HDR image from the Zivid camera with fully
            configured settings for each frame.
          - [CaptureSavePLY](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/CaptureSavePLY.hdev) - Capture a 3D color point cloud from the camera and save it
            to a PLY file format.
          - [CaptureWithSettingsFromYML](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/CaptureWithSettingsFromYML.hdev) - Capture a 2D color image, a 3D point cloud without colour
            and 2D color image + 3D color point cloud from the camera
            and use them to generate HALCON ObjectModel3D which is then
            visualized.
          - [ConnectToSerialNumberCamera](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Basic/ConnectToSerialNumberCamera.hdev) - Connect to a specific Zivid 3D camera based on its serial
            number.
      - **Advanced**
          - [CaptureHDRLoop](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/Advanced/CaptureHDRLoop.hdev) - Capture HDR images from the camera in a loop (while
            actively changing some HDR settings).
      - **InfoUtilOther**
          - [QuerySettingsAndParameters](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/InfoUtilOther/QuerySettingsAndParameters.hdev) - Query information about the image acquisition interface
            and selected specific parameters of Zivid camera.
          - [Warmup](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Camera/InfoUtilOther/Warmup.hdev) - A basic warm-up method for a Zivid camera with specified
            time and capture cycle.
  - **Applications**
      - **Basic**
          - **FileFormats**
              - [ReadPLY](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Applications/Basic/FileFormats/ReadPLY.hdev) - Import and display a Zivid point cloud from a PLY
                file.
      - **Advanced**
          - **ObjectMatching**
              - [SurfaceMatchingCreateModel](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Applications/Advanced/ObjectMatching/SurfaceMatchingCreateModel.hdev) - Create a model for HALCON surface-based 3D matching
                algorithm from a Zivid point cloud captured by a camera.
              - [SurfaceMatchingCreateModelFromFile](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Applications/Advanced/ObjectMatching/SurfaceMatchingCreateModelFromFile.hdev) - Create a model for HALCON surface-based 3D matching
                algorithm from a Zivid point cloud loaded from a ZDF
                file.
              - [SurfaceMatchingFindModel](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Applications/Advanced/ObjectMatching/SurfaceMatchingFindModel.hdev) - Utilize surface-based 3D matching on data taken with a
                Zivid camera.
              - [SurfaceMatchingFindModelFromFile](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-halcon-samples/tree/master/source/Applications/Advanced/ObjectMatching/SurfaceMatchingFindModelFromFile.hdev) - Utilize surface-based 3D matching on data taken with a
                Zivid camera.

## Installation

Zivid offers two ways of interfacing with HALCON:

1.  Through the Zivid SDK, utilizing the C++/C\# libraries available for
    HALCON. We provide samples for both
    [C++](https://support.zivid.com/latest//api-reference/samples/cpp.html)
    and
    [C\#](https://support.zivid.com/latest//api-reference/samples/csharp.html).
    (**Recommended**)
2.  Directly through a GenICam GenTL producer that comes with the [Zivid
    Software](https://support.zivid.com/latest//getting-started/software-installation.html).

Zivid and HALCON are compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and Ubuntu
20.04, 22.04, 24.04.

-----

Note:

> Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is removed since SDK 2.10.

The following HALCON versions have been tested and confirmed to work
with Zivid cameras:

  - 19.05 Progress, 20.05 Progress, 21.11 Progress, 24.05 Progress, 
    24.11 Progress-Steady, 25.05 Progress

We recommend using one of the HALCON versions we have tested.
