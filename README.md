## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and
**Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on
how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use
the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D
image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data
from the camera can be used.
